# P25 Protocol Processing & Event Extraction - Trunk-Decoder

## Project Overview
Implementation of comprehensive P25 protocol decoding and live event extraction system that receives raw P25 bitstreams from trunk-recorder and forwards processed events to trunk-player.

## Architecture - Protocol Processing Hub
```
trunk-recorder → trunk-decoder → trunk-player
  (raw P25)      (decode + events)  (alerts + storage)
```

## Role in P25 Ecosystem
- **Receive**: Raw P25 control channel bitstreams from trunk-recorder
- **Decode**: Comprehensive P25 protocol parsing (based on sdrtrunk knowledge)
- **Extract**: All protocol events (OSP/ISP/LC/System events)
- **Forward**: Processed events and metadata to trunk-player
- **Centralize**: Single authoritative P25 protocol implementation

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Raw Bitstream Reception

- [ ] Implement shared library interface for direct integration
- [ ] Add bitstream validation and integrity checking
- [ ] Design bitstream buffer management system
- [ ] Add authentication and security for API access

### Phase 2: P25 Protocol Decoding Engine
- [ ] Implement comprehensive P25 frame synchronization

- [ ] Implement PDU (Protocol Data Unit) parsing
- [ ] Add Link Control (LC) message decoding
- [ ] Support both Phase 1 and Phase 2 P25 protocols
- [ ] Implement error correction and validation

### Phase 3: Event Extraction System

- [ ] Extract all ISP (Inbound Signaling Packet) events  
- [ ] Implement Link Control event processing
- [ ] Add System status and infrastructure events
- [ ] Create comprehensive event metadata enrichment
- [ ] Add emergency event prioritization

### Phase 4: Event Processing & Forwarding
- [ ] Design event processing pipeline
- [ ] Implement event filtering and routing
- [ ] Add real-time event streaming to trunk-player
- [ ] Create event storage and replay capabilities
- [ ] Add event analytics and pattern detection
- [ ] Implement event deduplication and validation

### Phase 5: Integration & Performance
- [ ] Add configuration management for P25 processing
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring and metrics
- [ ] Add debugging and diagnostic capabilities
- [ ] Create comprehensive logging system
- [ ] Performance optimization for real-time processing
- [ ] Add unit tests and integration tests

## P25 Events to Extract
Based on sdrtrunk analysis - comprehensive protocol event coverage:

### Outbound Signaling Packet (OSP) Events
- Group voice channel grants and updates
- Unit-to-unit voice channel management
- Data channel allocations and announcements
- Unit registration and authentication
- System status broadcasts and alerts
- Location and affiliation management
- Emergency response coordination

### Inbound Signaling Packet (ISP) Events  
- Service requests (voice, data, emergency)
- Unit registration and location updates
- Group affiliation requests
- Status updates and responses
- Authentication and security events

### Link Control (LC) Events
- Call setup and teardown
- Emergency declarations
- Encryption status changes
- Call participant management

### System Infrastructure Events
- Site failover and status changes
- Control channel updates
- Network configuration changes
- Service availability notifications

## API Interfaces

### P25 Bitstream Reception
```
POST /api/v1/p25-bitstream
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
Authorization: Bearer <api-key>

Body: Raw P25 bitstream data + metadata
```

### Event Output to Trunk-Player
```
POST /api/v1/events/live
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "event_type": "OSP_GROUP_VOICE_CHANNEL_GRANT",
  "timestamp": 1634567890123456,
  "system_id": 12345,
  "talkgroup_id": 54321,
  "unit_id": 98765,
  "frequency": 460.1250,
  "emergency_flag": false,
  "metadata": { ... }
}
```

## Shared Library Interface
```cpp
// Direct integration interface for trunk-recorder
int process_p25_bitstream(const uint8_t* data, size_t length, 
                         const P25BitstreamMetadata* metadata);

// Event callback for trunk-player integration
typedef void (*p25_event_callback_t)(const P25Event* event);
int register_p25_event_callback(p25_event_callback_t callback);
```

## Performance Requirements
- **Real-time processing**: Process P25 bitstream with < 10ms latency
- **High throughput**: Handle multiple concurrent control channels
- **Event streaming**: < 100ms end-to-end latency for emergency events
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for continuous monitoring
- **Scalability**: Support multiple trunk-recorder instances

## Development Priority
1. **Bitstream reception** (API + library interfaces)
2. **P25 protocol decoding** (comprehensive parser implementation)
3. **Event extraction** (all protocol events)
4. **Event forwarding** (real-time streaming to trunk-player)
5. **Performance optimization** (real-time requirements)

## Integration with Existing Projects
- **trunk-recorder**: Receives raw P25 bitstreams via API/library
- **trunk-player**: Forwards processed events for alerting/storage
- **sdrtrunk knowledge**: Leverage comprehensive P25 implementation
- **Standalone operation**: Can process P25 data from any source
